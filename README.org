* Overview

/Entmut: for when your data structures are feeling treeish./

This package provides several implementations of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)][tree data structure]] and
iterator-like traits for working with them.

This is a work in progress. Several abstractions are still being
planned/explored/experimented with.

** Traits

| Trait             | Description                     | Tree data                        | Tree structure |
|-------------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------|
| =entmut::Nav=     | Fixed-topology tree navigation. | Read-only or internally mutable. | Read-only.     |

** Implementations

 - =entmut::fixed::Tree= :: fixed-layout tree structures with good memory
      locality guarantees
 - =entmut::owned::Tree= :: single-ownership structures wherein a parent owns
      its children
 - =entmut::shared::Tree= :: reference-counted pointers that can be shared
      between trees
